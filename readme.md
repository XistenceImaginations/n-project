# n-Project

## The intention
This is a simple prototype for studying some concepts. Included are:
- Create a custom syntax for writing HTML or CSS
- Using shadow-dom for creating components and scoping CSS/JS
- Create reactive content
- Make all running in Browser without build-system/compiler

## How to install
The only thing to install is a local webserver for developing. If you have an own solution for a webserver you can leave out the installation. Otherwise:
- run ```npm i``` in the root of this project-folder
- run ```npm run serve``` to start the server at http://localhost:8080. Open http://localhost:8080/public in your browser if it is not open automatically by starting running the NPM-task.

## How to use
Use ```index.html``` as reference how to include the neccessary files. Files included by n-Project must be provided in the root folder (.css, .js, .n) by the webserver.
